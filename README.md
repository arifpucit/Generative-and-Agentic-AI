Welcome to the **Generative and Agentic AI Course** repository! This collection contains Python program source codes containing Proof of Concepts (PoCs) discussed during this course lectures.

## 📚 About This Repository

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for students enrolled in the Generative and Agentic AI course. Each program demonstrates fundamental concepts through practical Python implementations, making complex theoretical concepts tangible and understandable.

### 🔗 Course Resources
- **Lecture Slides**: [http://arifbutt.me/cources](http://arifbutt.me/cources)
- **Course Level**: Undergraduate + Graduate
- **Programming Language**: Python

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Programming in Python
- Hands-on understanding of Machine Learning
- Understanding of Deep Learning concepts will be a plus
- Mac/Windows/Linux/Unix environment

### How to Use This Repository
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Use requirements.txt to build your virtual environment (Detailed steps mentioned in Notebook-00.ipynb

## 📖 Learning Approach

> **Important Note**: While these source codes are provided to save your typing efforts, I **strongly recommend** that you:
> 
> - ✅ Type the programs yourself for better understanding
> - ✅ Make modifications and experiment with the code
> - ✅ Do "Scuba Diving" into the underlying concepts

### 🎯 Learning Philosophy
*"The best way to learn programming is by programming!"* 

Don't just copy-paste the code. Engage with it, modify it, break it, and fix it. This hands-on approach will deepen your understanding of involved concepts.
