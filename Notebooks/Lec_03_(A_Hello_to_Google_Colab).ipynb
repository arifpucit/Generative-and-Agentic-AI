    "  - **Pay as You Go:** (\\\\$9.99 for 100 compute units, each unit cost \\\\$0.1). Compute units are special credits used to run premium GPUs (T4, A100, L4), TPUs (v2-8, v5e-1, v6e-1), and or high RAM. Unused compute units will expire after 90 days.\n",

    "- Hugging Face Integration Inside Colab\n",
    "    - Access the Hugging Face Hub directly using huggingface_hub commands.\n",
    "    - Clone, test, or create Hugging Face Spaces (Streamlit, Gradio, FastAPI apps) from Colab.\n",
